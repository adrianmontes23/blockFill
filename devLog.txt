First things first i began on december 24th 
I created the window and the lines for the board
I made a block class on the 25th i made blocks move and not leave the screan
next up im gonna make the blocks eithr snap on or detect which space thier in
Ill have to make both anyway but for now ill make them grey out when moving
I didnt use grey but cyan instead looks a lil nicer
Now ill try to make it snap into place should be simple what would be harder would 
be keeping track of the thingies now ill try sum
Blocks now snap next up, actually take a space up 
code wise.
Blocks take up spaces in code now, time to make more
appear when the current ones are used up.
They are now replaceable easy enough ill now move on 
to make them return if the move is invalid.
Blocks can now return and are successfuly placed
I did have a problem where clicking on the screen after 
placing a block would return it but fixed now.
Next up are really only harder things left which
kind of worry me since I kind of do not want to do 
them but are core parts of the game
Heres a list of 3 I can think of off the top of me head
Line completion to score
actually clearing the lines
randomly creating multi block blocks 
The hardest one will most likely be block things since
a major part will be placing them
I have completed a system that knows what rows and columns have been filled
next up is a way to destroy the columns if 
it has been filled. But First ill commit rq
