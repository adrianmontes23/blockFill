First things first i began on december 24th 
I created the window and the lines for the board
I made a block class on the 25th i made blocks move and not leave the screan
next up im gonna make the blocks eithr snap on or detect which space thier in
Ill have to make both anyway but for now ill make them grey out when moving
I didnt use grey but cyan instead looks a lil nicer
Now ill try to make it snap into place should be simple what would be harder would 
be keeping track of the thingies now ill try sum
